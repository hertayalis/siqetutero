Alex Canchari was recognized as a highly skilled jockey at the time of his demise, and his death has left his fans and loved ones in deep sorrow.</p><p>The horse racing community has been offering prayers and condolences to Alex’s family. His untimely death at the age of 29 has been described as devastating, with many expressing the sentiment that he was taken too soon. The family has requested privacy during this difficult period following the announcement by his sister.</p><h2>Who Is Alex Canchari’s Wife? Marriage Life</h2><p><strong>Alex Canchari</strong> had not entered into marriage, but he was in a relationship with <strong>Brooke-Lyn</strong>, according to multiple sources. The couple lived together with their two children. There is a need for more details regarding Brooke-Lyn and her relationship with Alex. While some reports indicated that they were already married, others maintained that they were not. It was also reported that they were engaged and on the verge of getting married. Alex, known for his reserved nature, never shared much information about his girlfriend.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/newsnownigeria.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Alex-Canchari-1.jpg alt="Alex Canchari" width=400 height=400 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Further information about Brooke-Lyn, the wife of the jockey, was scarce, as Alex rarely posted photos with her on social media. His social media activity was primarily centered around his racing career, and he refrained from publicly disclosing details about his personal life, likely to shield his spouse during difficult times, such as after his death.</p><h2>Alex Canchari and Brooke-Lyn Kids: Family Information</h2><p><strong>Alex Canchari</strong> had two children, with the youngest, Penelope, being two years old, and their first child set to turn four this year. Although details about their children were not widely shared in public, he was known to be a devoted father to both. The couple had chosen not to divulge much about their children, reflective of the trend among many celebrities to maintain their children’s privacy.</p><p>Canchair had a upbringing in a well-established household alongside two siblings. His sister, Ashley Canchair, was the one to inform the public about his passing. “My heart physically aches,” she expressed. “I’m so sorry you were in such pain, Alex, and felt there was no way out.” Alex also had an older brother who was a successful rider until a 2022 accident compelled his retirement. Alex shared a close bond with his father and brother, Patrick, and there are numerous pictures of them together.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/newsnownigeria.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Alex-Canchari-2.jpg alt="Alex Canchari" width=400 height=400 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>Alex Canchari’s Net Worth At The Time Of Death</h2><p>At the time of his passing, Alex was estimated to have a net worth of $1 million, with over 1,000 victories to his name and a substantial income.
