However, Soaps.com may receive a commission on orders placed through its retail links, and the retailer may receive certain auditable data for accounting purposes.</p><p>After the writers’ explosive return to Days of Our Lives, things have slowed down a bit while they set things in order and set up the next batch of big stories. And chief among those are Gabi and Abigail returning! Maybe Abigail. Definitely Gabi.</p><h2>Musical Jobs</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/stefan-blackmails-ej-days-jj-jpi.jpg alt="Holding a manilla envelope in the DiMera mansion, Stefan glares at EJ" width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>I did not see Kristen being put into the CEO chair and EJ getting put back as the DA when the writers returned. That happened fast, then Kristen disappeared, which was a bit disappointing. But I suppose EJ was put in there back before the strike, so they wanted him back to fulfill his original purpose. And I’m guessing that’s him being forced by Stefan to get her out of prison. Which should be happening next week! Or at the very least, we’ll finally be seeing Gabi again next week! (See what Cherie Jimenez had to say <a href=# rel=noopener>about taking over the role here</a>.)</p><p>So we’ve got everything in position for Gabi’s freedom and the truth about Jude’s father coming out. Though I can’t imagine Stefan revealing it out of vindictiveness if EJ gives him exactly what he wants. My guess? Leo will finally figure it out and, on this new path of being a better person, decide to tell Nicole and Eric.</p><p>Also, what’s happening with Melinda now? She was kind of written into a corner where her only leverage for staying out of trouble with Rafe was being the DA. Now she’s got nothing.</p><h2>False Alarm</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/johnny-chanel-lani-cake-days-jj-jpi.jpg alt="Johnny Chanel Lani cakes DAYS" width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>EJ’s cheerful bursting in on Paulina’s party amused me (before he strong armed Paulina into firing Melinda and giving him his job back), and I’m happy we got to celebrate Juneteenth and Paulina and Abe’s anniversary… But was that it for Lani and Eli? We got a few scenes as they pop in for a surprise visit?</p><p>It’s even less exciting because Lani’s talk with Chanel was, I think, for naught. <a href=# rel=noopener>Next week’s spoilers</a> have them getting news that could change everything, so I’m pretty sure all this exit drama really was just a red herring!</p><h2>Abigail, Is That You?</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/JPI_Episode14882_0002067807-e1718633891204.jpg alt="Days' Mystery Woman/maybe Abigail hugs herself and looks back in an empty room" width=1024 height=599 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>OK, Abigail (or not-Abigail?) has finally been sighted! At least the back of her. On grainy footage. Now let’s get to her rescue and into this “Is she or isn’t she” story. With that said, I don’t know how fans will react, though, if she turns out to be a fake. Well, I kind of do. There may be a revolt after teasing a character’s return, especially with someone who a lot of folks don’t think should have died at all. But <a href=# rel=noopener>AnnaLynne McCord did promise</a> lots of twists and turns, so whatever we think we know, it’s bound to upend things.</p><p>I also love that Julie is involved in the search for Abigail and I especially liked her spiel to Chad about being in danger. Julie is not and has never been a shrinking violet. Hell, in the first episode of the show, she was arrested for stealing! So calm down, Chad, she can handle herself and I’m thrilled she’s taking an active role in something besides that time capsule.</p><h2>Goodbye Harris, Take Two</h2><p>They’re wrapping up this busting Clyde out of prison thing pretty quick and easy. Justin’s confident he can get Steve off and the others aren’t involved. Over and done. I guess that’s something the writers didn’t want held over everyone’s head.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/JPI_Episode14827_0002053419.jpeg alt='Steve Burton, Tamara Braun "Days of our Lives" Set NBC Studios Burbank 09/28/23 © XJJohnson/jpistudios.com 310-657-9661 Episode # 14827 U.S.Airdate 4/03/24' width=1024 height=599 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>As for co-conspirator Ava: The Friday cliffhanger was… not my favorite. Judging by Monday’s spoilers, this is Harris’ final goodbye, so I’m not sure how much uncertainty there is there. Plus, aside from the fact that I don’t think many folks ever warmed up to him, it’s not going to have a ton of impact since he’s been mostly MIA for a while now.</p><p>About the only question is whether Ava is going with him. And that, I’m certain, is a big “No.” Tamara Braun was at the show’s 15,000th episode taping. I just hope they find something for her to do — and a pairing that gets folks excited! She keeps getting put with exiting characters and now she’s gone from mob princess to barista. Please find something for her.</p><h2>Teen Wave</h2><p>I like what they were trying to do with the teens and the prom (side note, we got an actual prom!) but I feel like they’ve been shunted to the side too much recently for the whole thing to have enough impact. The prom went from “Is it happening?” to “Everyone’s getting ready for it in five minutes!” out of nowhere. But I am thrilled that they actually gave us a prom! It wasn’t super epic, but I was a little nervous on Thursday that we’d just get hall scenes.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/aaron-sophia-days-jj.png alt="An animated Aaron points across a Brady Pub table at a slouching Sophia" width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>And no offense to Holly and Tate, but I’m kind of more invested in Sophia and Aaron right now. We don’t see her much, but Madelyn Kientz was phenomenal with Sophia’s anger and hurt. I wasn’t sure if she’d be turned into the vindictive, scorned lover, but they pulled back on that — though ratting Holly and Tate out is definitely going to come back to bite her.</p><p>And Louis Tomeo gave Aaron an awkward nervousness every time he talked to Sophia that was oh so believable. I want these two kids to work out! Forget Holly and Tate, those two are a mess.</p><h2>Just No</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/justin-alex-kiriakis-mansion-days-peacock.png alt="Justin earnestly faces Alex in the Kiriakis mansion" width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Alex’s dismissal of Justin trying to warn him to be careful with Theresa annoyed the hell out of me. He shot Justin down as both his dad and also a man who’s been through a ton and is a lot wiser than him. I know Alex doesn’t know how to act with him, but I also know that just about the only wrong way to act is by being a prick to the man who raised you! I can’t wait until Theresa leaves him for Brady or this blows up in their faces and she just flat out leaves him.</p><h2>Stray Thoughts…</h2><ul><li>I knew it was a dream, but Theresa’s Brady fantasy was still darn convincing. He told her: “I look at you, and all I see is Lucy holding that football.” And then he went right in for the kiss. Honestly, Dream Brady seems pretty accurate to Real Brady.</li></ul><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/brady-kiss-theresa-days-jj.png alt="Wrapped in each other's arms, Brady and Theresa kiss" width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><ul><li>Nicole calling Aaron to get Holly to ask him to the dance was so awkward, I wanted to curl up in a ball.</li><li>They really got their money’s worth with those decorations. Prom hallway, gym, Salem Inn room.</li><li>I’m not hating Stefan’s vicious confidence. Sending Nicole prom pictures as he sends EJ a text saying to “Free Gabi tomorrow or else” was a nice touch to torture his brother. It’s so much better than when he and Gabi were setting Kristen up for child abuse.</li><li>Get ready for Diana’s return next week as Leo visits her in prison! If nothing else, this should be amusing.</li></ul><p><strong>Take a look at <a href=# rel=noopener>daytime’s best triangles of all time</a> in our photo gallery below!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmnZmpqHqwsoyorKtlnJ7Dpr%2BOrKaaqJKkxXCDkm5qbWtfnsBurdWaZKWdkau2r7OO</p></div><div id=links><a href=./is-kyrsten-sinema-gay-sexuality-partner-and.html>&#171;&nbsp;Is Kyrsten Sinema Gay Sexuality Partner And Dating History</a>
