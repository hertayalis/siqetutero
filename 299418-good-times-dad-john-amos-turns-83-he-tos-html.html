Besides his special day, the actor had a lot to celebrate, including the love he received from his children.</p><p class=dh>According to his IMDb account, John was a father to six children from three different women he'd married over the years. In each relationship, the star allegedly welcomed two children.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/9b4cb12d3c193a1d80238d655a17d7b6.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>John Amos visited SiriusXM Studios on October 10, 2017, in New York City | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Two of <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0025309/bio>the children</a>, K.C.

The video started with Shannon asking the actor if she could have a dance with him.</p><p class=dh>The two then proceeded outside, where the star's daughter helped go down a few stairs with the help of a cane. How she balanced him and he leaned on the walking stick, showed how age was catching up with the famous star.</p><p class=dh>However, his love for his daughter saw him put the cane away so they could slow dance!
