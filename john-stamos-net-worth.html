He grew up with mother Loretta (a model), father William (a restaurateur), and younger sisters Janeen and Alaina. William was a Greek immigrant, and his surname was originally Stamatopoulos. When he was growing up, John worked at his father's fast food restaurants, and as a teenager, he worked at Duke's and Yellow Basket in Orange County. While attending <a href=# title="John F.
