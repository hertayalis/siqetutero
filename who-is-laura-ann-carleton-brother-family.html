Family</h1><div id=sub-header>July 2024 · 4 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p><strong>Who is the brother of Laura Ann Carleton? Following Carleton’s untimely death, her brother has been a focal point of interest.</strong></p><p>Lauri Carleton was a well-known entrepreneur who lived in Cedar Glen and was 66 years old.</p><p>One of her previous scholastic experiences was studying fashion at the Pasadena, California-based private Art Center College of Design.</p><p>She spent fifteen years working as an executive at the renowned fashion company Kenneth Cole after completing her studies.</p><p>Her excellent job and her important position in her large family defined her life, even outside of her line of work.</p><p>Unfortunately, Laura Ann “Lauri” Carleton was murdered on August 18, 2023.</p><p>Since then, there has been an increasing amount of interest in learning about her family’s history.</p><h2>Laura Ann Carleton’s brother: Who Is He? kin</h2><p>According to the most recent sources that are currently accessible, there have been no signs that Laura Ann Carleton had a sibling.</p><p>However, Lauri was a mother to nine children in all. One of her daughters expressed her sentiments to The New York Times over the phone.</p><p>She hoped that everyone would remember Laura’s spirit and that she died in a place she loved, where she would never back down from a fight for what was important to her.</p><p>Her family has been deeply affected by Laura’s sudden and sad death.</p><p>Although details about her parents and siblings are yet unknown, their emotional destruction is clearly severe.</p><p>If she had a sibling, he would have been devastated to lose her so quickly and severely; it would have seemed like the weight of the whole sky falling on top of him.</p><h2>Owner of Clothing Store: Laura Ann Carleton Passed Away</h2><p>Laura Ann Carleton was cruelly killed on August 18, 2023, probably as a result of flying a pride flag outside of Mag. Pi, her clothes boutique in Cedar Glen, California.</p><p>Law enforcement reports indicate that before shooting the victim, Travis Ikeguchi, the alleged assailant, made harsh remarks regarding the rainbow flag.</p><p>The suspect had expressed disapproval of the pride flag that was flying outside Carleton’s shop, according to the San Bernardino Sheriff’s Department.</p><p>Following an altercation, Carleton was shot, and the responding police declared him dead. The suspect’s presence in the vicinity was reported to the authorities.</p><p>Ikeguchi was found, armed, and engaged the police in combat. He was pronounced dead at the spot.</p><p>Through a tweet, director Paul Feig linked Carleton’s terrible death to a worrying rise in anti-LGBT prejudice.</p><p>He claims that what happened to Lauri is a complete tragedy and that anybody who believes that those who advocate against homosexuality and transgender issues are not harmful ought to reconsider.</p><p>Actress Bridget Everett also shared similar sentiments about this issue on Instagram, stating that there is a cost to all of the anti-LGBTQ propaganda.</p><p>Supervisor Dawn Rowe of San Bernardino County issued a statement lamenting the “senseless act of hate and violence.”</p><p>She also underlined the need for everyone to exercise their constitutional rights and live without prejudice.</p><p>The governor of California, Gavin Newsom, also denounced the event and mentioned that Lauri had left behind her husband and nine children.</p><p>He says the situation is really horrifying since a guy shot and murdered a store owner because the owner objected to the pride flag that was flying outside her establishment.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Is Deadliest Catch&#39;s Josh Harris Wed?
