And now that the baby is on the way, Cheyenne and Zach say they want to do more than work this time. According to what she revealed, the two gradually reconnected after Zach slid into her DM. There was a lot of talking over food, and they eventually made a promise to themselves to make it until forever “this time.”</p><p>Because the Ex on the Beach star wrote on Instagram, “This year you become a father and I am honored to carry your son,” it’s safe to assume they’re expecting a son.
