The Utah remains on the Pearl Harbor floor along with the Arizona. The Oklahoma was raised after a massive effort but proved to be too damaged to return to service.<h2>Can you dive to the USS Arizona?</h2>Because the Arizona is considered to be a memorial, it is unlawful for divers to enter the ship, so careful egresses are made using underwater rovers that document interior conditions.
