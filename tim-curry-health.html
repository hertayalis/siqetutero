A Daytime Emmy Award-winner, Tim has starred in hits such as It, <a href=#>Home Alone 2: Lost in New York</a>, and Muppet Treasure Island.</p><p>Unfortunately, Tim's health over the last decade or so has caused complications when it comes to performing.

The famed actor had a serious stroke in 2012 that left him requiring the use of a wheelchair.</p><p>"Tim had a stroke last July," the actor's rep told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter</a> in 2013. "He has been going to physical therapy doing very well and still has his great sense of humor. He thanks everyone for sending good wishes."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>By 2015, Tim had seemingly adjusted more to this major change in life. "I’m doing well and I’m looking forward to it," the actor told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Los Angeles Magazine</a> ahead of the 19th annual Actors Fund Tony Awards Viewing Party in Los Angeles. "I’ve done a few benefits for the Actors Fund and I think it’s a marvelous organization. I hope not to have to use it."</p><p>At that very event, Tim was honored with a lifetime achievement award.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"It means that it just sort of solidifies the kind of work the American acting community has given me for years now. It’s very gracious of them, I think. I was thrilled when they told me and I am thrilled now," he went on to tell the magazine at the time.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Tim Curry doing now?</h2><p>Tim may have lost mobility after the stroke, but the situation did nothing to diminish his love of acting. Being in a wheelchair has led him to scale back public appearances, but the star still appears for certain special events and ceremonies. On top of that, he has transitioned his acting career into one focused entirely on voice roles. Since his stroke, Tim has lent his voice talents to projects like Star Wars: The Clone Wars, Ribbit, and Ben 10: Omniverse.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>In October 2023, Tim was spotted by a fan attending CreepieCon 2023. Ironically, that fan happened to be Michael Taeza, who is a cosplay artist who rose to fame performing as the one and only Pennywise. What a treat it must have been to meet the legendary Tim in the flesh!</p><p>Additionally, Tim has been quite busy in 2023, as he's participated in a number of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GalaxyCon interviews</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Tim Curry best known for?</h2><p>Tim Curry is perhaps most recognizable for his role as Dr. Frank-N-Furter in 1975's The Rocky Horror Picture Show. But let's not forget his iconic turn as Wadsworth in Clue or his role as Pennywise in It.</p><p>Millennials probably recognize Tim from his unforgettable voice role as Nigel Thornberry in Nickelodeon's The Wild Thornberrys. In short, if you've consumed even a moderate amount of film, television, or theater in the past six or seven decades, chances are you've encountered a Tim Curry performance.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Tim Curry married? Does Tim Curry have children?</h2><p>Tim Curry has always led a pretty private life, so not much is known about his romantic life. But the actor has never been married, as far as the public knows, nor does he have any children of his own.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Tim Curry's net worth?</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Tim Curry's net worth lies around $12 million.
