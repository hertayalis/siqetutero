She had three siblings – Deanna Lombardo, Lisa Scordato, and Paul Lombardo – and was the second of four children.</p><p>Lombardo was blessed with a gift for languages, particularly German and Italian, thanks to her diligent Italian family. From a young age, she was a top scholar, and her parents beamed with pride at her ability to speak more than one language. After relocating to <a href=# rel=noopener>New York City</a>, Lombardo attended Bayside High School before receiving a degree in English Literature from Adelphi University.</p><p>Although rumors circulated about Lombardo being a student at California University, she instead attended Towson University in Maryland. In 1987, she graduated in business administration and acquired a second bachelor’s degree in science in 1992. Allegedly, she went to the Fashion Institute of Technology. Ultimately, she earned her master’s in Educational Leadership and Administration General from the Australian Catholic University.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Career></span>Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In 1985, Denise Lombardo achieved fame by getting married to her then-husband, but she has been a devoted worker all her life. She was employed as a salesperson with the Modern Medical System Company from 1993 to 2000. In 2000, she moved on to The Home Depot Company, where she specializes in flooring.</p><p>From 2006 to 2008, Lombardo was employed by Smith & Nephew Company. She was a real asset and was involved in fashion projects such as Laurevan Shoe, Blu Marine, Genny-Byblos, and Stefano Bravo.</p><p>In 2010, Lombardo began her journey in the real estate business. Although her ex-husband’s fame has followed her, Lombardo has worked diligently to create her own success and build her brand. She acquired her real estate license that same year and eventually became a real estate agent for Douglas Elliman.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Denise_Lombardo_Jordan_Belforts_Relationship></span>Denise Lombardo & Jordan Belfort’s Relationship<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In their youth, <a href=# rel=noopener>Jordan Belfort</a> and Denise Lombardo were given the moniker of ‘Sweethearts’ by their peers. The two had known each other since high school, Lombardo studying merchandising and Belfort as a door-to-door meat salesman. Despite Lombardo being described as a lovely but submissive wife in a previous interview, the couple’s marriage was ultimately short-lived.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Denise-Lombardo-husband.webp alt="Denise Lombardo husband" width=800 height=500 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Even when Belfort was very young, he had an entrepreneurial attitude and earned $20,000 with Elliot Loewenstern while still in secondary school. Despite the financial struggles they encountered at the start of their marriage, they persevered and helped each other through the hardships.</p><p>After Belfort was let go from L.F. Rothschild as a trainee stockbroker, he and Danny Porush created a new business with an investment of $250,000. Despite the financial hardships, Lombardo stayed by their side and would even offer her assistance.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Divorce></span>Divorce<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Denise Lombardo and Jordan Belfort were wed for five years between 1985 and 1991. Although the early years of matrimony were difficult, their bond held strong and they managed to overcome the financial hardships they encountered, making it feel like a decade of strife.</p><p>Belfort soon found out that by making fraudulent offers he could bring in more money. This resulted in a shift from barely having enough to live on to having an excess, and this had a detrimental effect on him since he got into a habit of substance abuse. His extra-marital affairs also put a strain on his connection with Lombardo.</p><p>Jordan gradually became more and more absorbed by his new life, leading him to substance abuse and infidelity. These behaviors tested Denise’s endurance and loyalty, yet she still remained forgiving and accommodating, repeatedly giving Jordan a chance to make amends. In the end, Jordan’s cheating was more than their marriage could take, and so Denise and Jordan split in 1991.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Jordan-Belfort-Nadine.webp alt="Jordan Belfort, Nadine" width=690 height=460 data-sizes="(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Where_is_Denise_Lombardo_now></span>Where is Denise Lombardo now?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 1994, Denise Lombardo tied the knot with her beau, Mlady. It is thought that the two have been content ever since. Little else is familiar about the duo, as Denise has stayed tight-lipped about her private life. She doesn’t have any presence on social media and does not possess an Instagram account.</p><p>After the heartbreaking split, Denise chose to put her career before anything else. She has been striving to reach professional goals, avoiding the spotlight, and seeking a tranquil life far from the American public and media scrutiny. She and her husband, Mlady, are currently living in Washington, D.C.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbXPraarp16YvK57z2ibnqaZqLJuuM6mmZqqlKR6o7XOoKmaqJiueqK4y2awqK1do7KmsIytpmajnqTEbq3BqKytZZqkv6WtzWaZnqSWpL%2B1v4xqqq1lp56zpns%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./blair-thomas-jets-fumble.html>&#171;&nbsp;Blair Thomas and the fumble that changed the course of his short career</a>
